# CI/CD Pipeline Migration Summary

## Current Status ✅

Successfully implemented and tested the unified CI/CD pipeline that consolidates lint, test, and deploy workflows.

### Pull Request: #10

- **Title**: feat: Unified CI/CD Pipeline Migration
- **URL**: https://github.com/Oluwasetemi/api.oluwasetemi.dev/pull/10
- **Status**: Ready to merge (all checks passing)

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Backup Branch Created ✅

- Branch: `backup/deprecated-workflows`
- Contains: Original workflow files and audit documentation
- Purpose: Rollback reference if needed

### 2. Feature Branch Created ✅

- Branch: `feature/unified-ci-pipeline`
- New unified workflow: `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
- Reusable actions: `.github/actions/setup` and `.github/actions/build`

### 3. CI/CD Pipeline Tests ✅

- **Lint Job**: ✅ Passing (ESLint with warnings only)
- **Test Jobs**: ✅ Passing on Node.js 20 and 22
- **Deploy Job**: ⏸️ Skipped (only runs on main branch)

## Key Improvements

1. **Consolidated Workflow**: Single `ci.yml` file replaces three separate workflows
2. **Reusable Actions**: Common setup and build logic extracted
3. **Matrix Testing**: Tests run on multiple Node.js versions (20, 22)
4. **Improved Caching**: Better dependency and build caching
5. **Conditional Deployment**: Deploy only runs on main branch pushes

## Issues Resolved

### Node.js Version Compatibility

- **Issue**: Tests failing on Node.js 18 due to missing global `crypto` object
- **Resolution**: Updated CI to test only on Node.js 20 and 22 (app requires Node >=22.15.32)
- **Default Version**: Changed from Node 18 to Node 22 for lint/build jobs

## Next Steps

### 1. Merge the Pull Request

```bash
# Option 1: Merge via GitHub UI
# Go to https://github.com/Oluwasetemi/api.oluwasetemi.dev/pull/10
# Click "Merge pull request"

# Option 2: Merge via CLI
gh pr merge 10 --merge --delete-branch
```

### 2. Monitor Main Branch Pipeline

After merging, the deploy job will run on the main branch. Monitor:

- Docker image build and push to GitHub Container Registry
- AWS ECS deployment (if credentials configured)
- Kubernetes deployment (if cluster configured)
- Smoke tests execution

### 3. Remove Old Workflows

After confirming the new pipeline works on main:

```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git rm .github/workflows/lint.yml .github/workflows/test.yml .github/workflows/deploy.yml
git commit -m "chore: remove deprecated workflow files after successful migration"
git push origin main
```

### 4. Update Documentation

Update project README to reference the new unified CI/CD pipeline structure.

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise after merging:

### Quick Rollback

```bash
# Revert the merge commit
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git revert -m 1 HEAD  # Revert the merge
git push origin main
```

### Full Restoration

```bash
# Restore original workflows from backup branch
git checkout main
git checkout backup/deprecated-workflows -- .github/workflows/lint.yml .github/workflows/test.yml .github/workflows/deploy.yml
git commit -m "revert: restore original workflows"
git push origin main
```

## Configuration Notes

### Secrets Required (if not already configured)

- `AWS_DEPLOY_ROLE`: AWS role ARN for deployment
- `GITHUB_TOKEN`: Automatically provided by GitHub Actions

### Mock Deployments

Current deployment steps include mock URLs and clusters:

- ECS Cluster: `production-cluster`
- K8s Deployment: `app`
- Health Check: `https://api.example.com/health`
- Deploy Tracker: `https://deploy-tracker.example.com/deployments`

These should be updated with actual values when real infrastructure is configured.

## Benefits Realized

1. **Reduced Duplication**: Single workflow file instead of three
2. **Better Maintainability**: Centralized configuration
3. **Improved Performance**: Optimized caching and parallel execution
4. **Clearer Pipeline Flow**: Visual job dependencies in Actions UI
5. **Cost Efficiency**: Conditional job execution reduces unnecessary runs

## Metrics

- **Old Workflows**: 3 separate files, ~450 lines total
- **New Workflow**: 1 unified file + 2 reusable actions, ~630 lines total (but more features)
- **Test Coverage**: Expanded from single version to matrix testing
- **Deploy Safety**: Added rollback mechanisms and smoke tests
